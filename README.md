- Added tailwindcss to the project
- Preferred using scss over css in development to be able to use its features
- Refactored the `tailwind.config.js` file to `tailwind.config.ts` to be able to use typescript which will be handy with types safety and intellisense when adding plugins or extending the configuration
- Made sure the `content` in the `tailwind.config.ts` file is set to the proper paths
